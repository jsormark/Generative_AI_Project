# Generative_AI_Project
The following project looks to showcase capabilities as it relates to generative AI and document analysis, legal documents sourced from Australia. The project looks to extract text from the database of legal documents, utilizing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and vector databases to conduct queries.  

This project is a work in progress as I am doing this on the side when I have free time. I will be adding content and inputs as I progress.
