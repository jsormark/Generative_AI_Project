# Generative_AI_Project
The following project looks to showcase capabilities as it relates to generative AI and document analysis, legal documents sourced from Australia. The project looks to extract text from the database of legal documents, utilizing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and vector databases to conduct queries.  

# Data
The data to be utilized for this case study is sourced from Kaggle.com, Open Australian Legal Corpus, which is a compilation of over 202,000 texts related to statutes and regulations in the Australian commonwealth. Kaggle source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus/data

This project is a work in progress as I am doing this on the side when I have free time. I will be adding content and inputs as I progress.
